# Black Friday Sales – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

##  Project Overview
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Black Friday sales dataset to understand customer purchasing behavior, demographic patterns, and product-wise spending trends. The analysis helps uncover insights related to age, gender, occupation, city category, and product purchases.

---

##  Objectives
- Analyze customer demographics and their impact on purchase behavior
- Understand spending patterns across age groups and genders
- Explore city category and occupation-wise purchase trends
- Identify high-revenue product categories
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing for analysis

---

## Dataset Information
- Dataset: Black Friday Sales Dataset
- Format: CSV
- Contains information such as:
  - User demographics (Age, Gender, Marital Status)
  - City category and years of stay
  - Occupation
  - Product categories
  - Purchase amount

---

## Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
The following preprocessing steps were performed:
- Handling missing values in product category columns
- Encoding categorical variables for analysis
- Converting data types where required
- Removing inconsistencies in categorical features

---

## Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA techniques used in this project include:
- **Univariate analysis** to study individual features such as age, gender, and purchase amount
- **Bivariate analysis** to understand relationships between:
  - Gender and purchase behavior
  - Age groups and total spending
  - City category and purchase trends
- Visualizations such as bar plots, histograms, and count plots to identify patterns

---

## Key Insights
- Male customers contribute a higher share of total purchase value
- Certain age groups show significantly higher purchasing behavior
- City category influences spending patterns
- Some product categories dominate overall sales

---

##  Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Conclusion
This EDA provides valuable insights into customer behavior and purchasing trends during Black Friday sales. The findings can help businesses improve targeted marketing strategies, customer segmentation, and inventory planning.

##  Future Enhancements
- Feature engineering for predictive modeling
- Purchase amount prediction using machine learning models
- Customer segmentation using clustering techniques
- Dashboard creation using Power BI or Tableau
